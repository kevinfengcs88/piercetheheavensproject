<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Old-RuneScape-Soundtrack-Newbie-Melody.mp3"></audio><figcaption><strong>Newbie Melody</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>The year is 2007 and you&#8217;re sitting in the oversized office chair  in front of the family computer. Legs dangling above the carpet and hand loosely grasping the old ball mouse, a familiar tune starts up. The Model M keyboard from IBM resounding with sharp clicks with every keypress, you stare intently at the adventure ahead.</p>



<p>RuneScape is more than just a nostalgic childhood videogame. Any game can fulfill that role, especially those that have less progression and open world aspects in design. But RuneScape is an MMORPG, a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, where the balance of &#8220;doing anything you want&#8221; to &#8220;restrictive gameplay&#8221; is held in perfect tandem. </p>



<p>The game is one set in a medieval fantasy, a Lord of the Rings type of world. You can train your combat skills to slay dragons, or improve your ability to fish and sell your goods for a profit. You can buy things and flip them for higher prices, like a merchant. You can plant trees and grow herbs, or even build your own house. But the most important thing of all is that you can interact with other players just like you. </p>



<p>The year is no longer 2007, and though RuneScape itself has changed, much of its original spirit and mechanics have been preserved in the release of Old School RuneScape in 2013. In both versions of the game&#8211;07 RuneScape and current day OSRS&#8211;exist(ed)(s) the Grand Exchange.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-1024x605.png" alt="" class="wp-image-426" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-1024x605.png 1024w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-300x177.png 300w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-768x453.png 768w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-830x490.png 830w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-230x136.png 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-350x207.png 350w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-480x283.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><strong>The Grand Exchange is always crowded with players.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Grand Exchange, or the GE, is a market that utilizes fundamental concepts from real-life economics. RuneScape does have shops in which players can purchase items from NPCs for GP, or gold pieces (called Coins in-game), but the GE hosts a far wider variety of items for sale. The way the GE functions is strikingly similar to real world laissez-faire economy. There is no government in RuneScape, and even if the moderators of the game could be considered a governmental system, they do little to interfere with the economy. No subsidies or transfer payments are done by Jagex Ltd., the company that owns the game, so the economy is completely ran by the individuals who also serve as businesses.</p>



<p>The Grand Exchange acts as a simple market place where players input goods at their own prices and request goods at their own prices. Players can buy and sell all tradeable items at whatever prices they wish (so long as the supply and demand agree) with only a few restrictions on how many items can be bought every four hours, depending on the item.</p>



<h3>The Economizing Problem</h3>



<p>RuneScape deals with the same economizing problem that the real world faces, but in a slightly different manner. But down to the core, the problem is still the same. <strong>Scarcity </strong>is the idea that society&#8217;s wants exceed society&#8217;s productive capacity, an idea prevalent throughout the RS economy. With unlimited wants and limited resources, decisions must be made to maximize the satisfaction of economic wants. This is underlying principle to economics as a whole.</p>



<p>One might argue that RuneScape does not have limited resources as fishing spots yield infinite fish, or that cows respawn seconds after killing them, but this is not actually true. The world of RuneScape may have a supply of infinite resources, but harvesting them and processing them into useful goods and services comes with a cost. The time, effort, and resource input that goes into harvesting a specific resource will ultimately determine its price on the Grand Exchange. </p>

They only restore 3 hitpoints though&#8230;</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If say, I want to buy 8 trillion shrimp, it&#8217;s not possible. Maybe 8 trillion shrimp will or have already been traded and existed in the game, but at the current time, they do not. The scarcity of resources may seem vastly different from the real world, but it is much more similar than one might think. In fact, all resources on Earth are renewable, just at different rates. We call fossil fuels nonrenewable resources because on the human timescale, they cannot be used up and replenished at the same or greater rate sustainably. Something like corn can be considered renewable, and is traded like coal is. Keeping this in mind, RuneScape actually has the same type of renewability on Earth, but at a much faster rate, and thus, holding an economizing problem.</p>



<p>To further prove the point that the economy of RuneScape holds the same economizing problem that we do in real life, opportunity costs exist in the game as well. An <strong>opportunity cost </strong>is simply the next best thing when making a decision, or what is given up. For example, if I know I have the next four hours to try and turn a profit, I will consider my options in a <strong>marginal analysis</strong>. I know that my fishing level is high, so I could spend the next four hours fishing and then selling what I harvest, or I could also try to woodcut and sell the logs that I harvest by the end of the time period. I can also determine the price of the, say sharks, that I am fishing for. I can determine the market value of a raw shark by checking the Grand Exchange, and in this case, each raw shark goes for 700 GP. I know with my fishing level of 99, I can catch approximately 130 sharks every hour, so [(130 sharks/hour) * (700 GP/1 shark) * (4 hours)] = [364,000 GP]. On the other hand, if I try to cut magic trees (I cut 130 magic logs per hour at 99 Woodcutting) , which yield magic logs (each of which is 955 GP) for the next four hours, then I make [(130 logs/hour) * (955 GP/1 logs) * (4 hours)] = [496,600 GP].</p>



<p>It seems rather clear that I should cut trees for the next four hours given only these two options, correct? Well, yes, but only in a <strong>ceteris paribus </strong>scenario. In economics, countless factors can influence prices, demand, and circumstances of resource-gathering, so to simplify relationships, all other variables are assumed to be equal, as stated in ceteris paribus. However, there are far more factors in this scenario than explained.</p>



<p> First of all, the only thing gained from fishing or woodcutting is not just the resources themselves. Experience is gained from each fish caught, or each set of logs cut. Experience goes into the skill, which with enough experience, increases level. Of course, in my scenario, I have the maximum level in both skills, meaning I have no concern for how much experience I gain. In a sense, experience can be viewed as investment in capital goods, like machinery or technology that improves efficiency. In the real world, investing in machinery will increase the rate at which that a good can be produced, so in RuneScape, considering the experience gained is analogous to considering the efficiency increase from investing in capital goods. Since the higher one&#8217;s level is in a certain skill, the more proficient they are in it (whether it be gathering a resource or being able to slay a more profitable monster), it is important to calculate multiple opportunity costs in a real scenario. </p>



<p>This situation can be even further complicated by using combinations of skill usage with the time given. Using the shark fishing route, for example, I could spend the first two hours fishing sharks, then the next hours cooking the sharks for food that I will use in the last hour to heal myself as I slay gargoyles that drop high value items. My initial capital hasn&#8217;t even been considered yet! Using the woodcutting route, I could spend the first hour chopping logs, then the next hour lighting fires with the logs I cut to cook the raw food already in my bank, and then the last two hours to use that food to heal myself while I pickpocket high value seeds from farmers that I can later use to grow crops I can sell. But for the optimal economic gain, far fewer combinations of skills are needed. Keep this scenario in mind, as it segues into an interaction we have in the real world.</p>



<p>Another concept that is easily applicable to both RuneScape and the real world is the <strong>budget line</strong>. A budget line shows the greatest attainable combination of goods/services that can be purchased at a specific income level. In real life, I might have $96 while I&#8217;m at the supermarket, considering purchasing two different foods. Let&#8217;s say that beans cost $12, while a bag of rice costs $8. Given this information, a budget line can be constructed. It would look a little something like this:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph-of-a-budget-constraint1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-440" width="517" height="470" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph-of-a-budget-constraint1.png 388w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph-of-a-budget-constraint1-300x273.png 300w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph-of-a-budget-constraint1-230x209.png 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph-of-a-budget-constraint1-350x318.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px" /></figure></div>



<p>Of course, budget lines exist in RuneScape, a game that has currency in it. It is interesting to note that RuneScape has multiple currencies, though only one (GP) is accepted on the Grand Exchange. The rest of the currencies are accepted by NPCs, like shopkeepers. The idea of a budget line demonstrates opportunity cost and is used consistently in RuneScape. For example, let&#8217;s say I have 10 million GP to spend on ammunition for Ranged training, and I am considering only arrows and crossbow bolts (ceteris paribus). Let&#8217;s say rune arrows cost 72 GP each, and broad bolts cost 63 GP each. That means I can buy either 138,888 rune arrows or 158,730 broad bolts if all my income is devoted to a single good. Then the opportunity cost for each can be determined, with rune arrows costing about 1.143 broad bolts, and each broad bolt costing the reciprocal of that in rune arrows, or about 0.875 rune arrows.</p>



<p>The budget line is very similar to a <strong>production possibilities curve</strong>, which demonstrates the maximum attainable combinations of goods (limited to two, ceteris paribus) that a nation can produce. This of course, can be applied to RuneScape in the same principle that the budget line works, except in production of goods, like say, fishing and woodcutting.</p>



<p>The differences between <strong>microeconomics </strong>and <strong>macroeconomics </strong>is even applicable to RuneScape. However, the differences between the two are far simpler than the real world. While microeconomics in real life is concerned with businesses and individuals and the decisions they make, RuneScape microeconomics is really just concerned with a single player, and sometimes, groups of players, known as clans, that influence the same or interconnected part(s) of the market. While macroeconomics in real life is concerned with unemployment, national economic health, and international trade, macroeconomics in RuneScape is just the status of the GE.</p>



<p>In addition, theoretical economics has some, albeit very limited, application to RuneScape. The two main types of statements made regarding economic theory are <strong>positive </strong>and <strong>normative</strong>. While positive statements are backed by facts or proven correlations (like supply going down increasing price), normative statements are backed by opinion. As for positive statements, merchants in RuneScape often use price tracking programs and other factors to predict prices. Let&#8217;s say a new item is introduced that enables players to deal more damage per second to a certain type of monster that drops substantially profitable amounts of sharks. A positive statement can be made that describes how the price of sharks will go down as the supply increases from a new source in-game. Of course, positive statements don&#8217;t have to be correct. In this scenario it wasn&#8217;t even considered whether or not food, like sharks themselves would be consumed more to heal against fighting this type of monster. It could be possible that the price of sharks remain constant, as both supply and demand shift (more on this later).</p>



<p>Output in RuneScape is similar to that of the real world, as it wouldn&#8217;t exist without the <strong>factors of production</strong>. The acronym CELL lists these as <strong>capital</strong>, <strong>entrepreneurial ability</strong>, <strong>land</strong>, and <strong>labor</strong>.  Capital comes in the forms of physical and human capital, and is NOT currency. Physical capital includes machinery and tools required to produce other goods, while human capital are skills and knowledge gained by a worker through experience and education. Physical capital is represented in RuneScape by the items required to obtain, or &#8220;produce&#8221; other goods, which include weaponry, armor, tools, and teleportation items. Anything that enables for more efficient resource gathering is considered physical capital. Human capital extends beyond the game itself, as the player controls a character. Whatever knowledge and skills the player has are vicariously experienced by the character. If the player has knowledge on the most efficient technique in producing some good, or if the player possesses practical skills that others do not, then that is additional human capital. As for entrepreneurial ability, almost everyone in RuneScape is considered an entrepreneur as long as they trade on the Grand Exchange or directly with other players. Entrepreneurs combine the other factors of production and take risks in hopes of turning a profit, which is exactly what all normal RuneScape players do. The only exception to this are completely independent players, known as Ironmen, who cannot trade with other players or utilize the Grand Exchange. Everything they obtain must be obtained by themselves. Land, or all the natural resources used to produce goods and services, as stated earlier, are infinite in RuneScape. However, due to time constraints and the effort put into it, items are scarce. Labor is something that is not given to businesses and firms in exchange for compensation however. In RuneScape, labor is the time and effort put into getting an item, which ultimately determines its price on the GE.</p>



<h3>Trade</h3>



<p>Trade is something that we know in the real world to occur often in the international community. But imagine if trading didn&#8217;t occur. Would we have toys that were mass-produced cheaply, or the various types of food we have available</p>



<p>Remember the scenario in which a marginal analysis was conducted with a few others factors in the game, like experience? This actually introduces the idea of <strong>specialization</strong>, something that I&#8217;ve genuinely and independently considered in my time playing RuneScape. Specialization is the idea that certain individuals, or countries in the case of the real world, become skilled and efficient in particular crafts or producing certain goods and services. For example, it&#8217;s common to hear the question &#8220;Why is everything made in China?&#8221; in the US. Many things are made in China that the US imports, and most of them require intensive labor, like toys and phones. China is efficient in producing goods like these because of the high population and the relatively low price to be paid for labor. Meanwhile, the US is more efficient at producing industrial goods, like airplanes, due to the higher levels of technology we have. Airplanes are an example of capital-intensive goods, while toys are an example of labor-intensive goods. There is a third main type of good for specialization, called land-intensive goods, which require large amounts of land to produce efficiently; for example, beef from cows as they require land to graze on.</p>



<p>Countries gain from specialization, as the premise of international trade is to have countries produce what they have lower opportunity costs for and then trade. The difference in opportunity costs for production of a product in terms of another for two countries is referred to as a <strong>comparative advantage</strong>, meaning one country has a lower opportunity cost than the other in Product A, while the other country has a lower opportunity cost than the other in Product B. This type of advantage is necessary for beneficial trade, while an <strong>absolute advantage</strong> is not required. An absolute advantage simply means one country can produce more of a product than another.</p>



<p>So how does specialization fit into RuneScape? It&#8217;s quite simple, really. Since RuneScape provides many options, opportunity costs arise. For example, if I know that sometime in the future I want to train my Magic, which requires runes for casting spells, I take into consideration what I should do now that would make that possible. Two simple options would be to train Runecrafting by crafting the necessary runes for training Magic, or to slay profitable monsters for money to later purchase runes. In RuneScape, combat is the most profitable money making method that is reliable, so all other skills are essentially rendered obsolete from a completely financial standpoint. In this case, if I can make 2 million GP/hour killing the snake boss, Zulrah (which also trains combat stats), or make 400k GP/hour crafting nature runes (which trains Runecrafting), it seems quite obvious that killing Zulrah is the better option. So why do people even Runecraft (even the highest level of runes cannot make more than 1 million or so GP/hour)? Why do people specialize in such a seemingly useless skill?</p>

<p>Simply put, not everything is about economic gain in RuneScape. Some people enjoy runecrafting more than combat, and runecrafting just happens to be a less potentially profitable method. It&#8217;s similar to how the representation of the female population in the STEM field is surprisingly low. The collective interests of females actually results in overall careers that make less money, which is not to say the individual female makes less than the individual male. </p>



<p>On top of that, distribution of skill levels in RuneScape are different across different players. This is similar to the three key reasons for trade in the real world, which are: (1) The distribution of natural, human, and capital resources are uneven among nations, (2) Not all nations have the same degree of technology, and (3) People have different preferences. The first and second reasons are analogous to players having different skill levels and different levels of competency in playing the game. The third reason has an interesting existence in RuneScape, however. In theory, specific preferences shouldn&#8217;t exist, as a sword bought from the Grand Exchange is the same sword that originates from mined ore, which is then smelted into bars, and then smithed into weaponry. But some players actually prefer having resources that they collected themselves, or like having that as a future option. Personally, I achieved 99 Fishing and Cooking so that if I would like to fish and cook my own food, I can do so efficiently. The thought process on this makes no financial sense, though, as even if the prices are high on food, I can always make more money with some type of combat and then purchase food, albeit, at a higher price. Once again, not everything is about economic gain in RuneScape. It is a game after all.</p>



<h3>Supply and Demand</h3>



<p>Supply and demand are some of the most crucial economic concepts in RuneScape, as the Grand Exchange goes completely untouched by Jagex (price controls are set by in-game stores) and is maintained through the principles found in real life markets. </p>



<p>A shift to the right is an increase, while a shift to the left is a decrease for both supply and demand (price is always on the y-axis and quantity is on the x-axis).</p>

<p><strong>Supply </strong>is a schedule or curve showing the various amounts of a product that producers are willing and able to make for sale at each of a series of possible prices during a specific period. The <strong>law of supply</strong> states that as price falls, quantity falls, and as price rises, quantity supplied rises. This follows common sense, as suppliers take advantage of higher prices on their products by producing more. </p>



<p>The <strong>determinants of supply</strong> are the factors that change the supply curve itself, so if any one of these factors change, the supply schedule is subject to shift left or right.</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>Demand </strong>is a schedule or a curve that shows the various amounts of a product that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a series of possible prices during a specified period of time. The <strong>law of demand </strong>is the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. This also follows common sense, as you are encouraged to buy products at lower prices, while feeling discouraged at higher prices. </p>



<p>The <strong>determinants of demand </strong>are the factors that change the demand curve itself, so if any one of these factors change, the demand schedule is subject to shift left or right.</p>



<ol><li>Consumers’ tastes<ul><li>Demand increases if the product is more desirable</li></ul></li><li>The number of buyers in the market<ul><li>An increase in the number of buyers will likely increase demand</li></ul></li><li>Consumer’s incomes<ul><li>A rise in income causes an increase in demand</li></ul></li><li>Prices of related goods<ul><li>If an increase in the price of a substitute occurs, then the demand for the other will increase</li><li>If the price of a complement goes up, the demand for the related good will decline</li><li>Unrelated goods have little to no effect on the demand for others</li></ul></li><li>Consumer expectations<ul><li>An increase or decrease in demand may occur when something is expected</li><li>If anticipated price is higher, then current demand may increase to “beat” the rising price</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>In RuneScape, aggregate supply and aggregate demand are the terms used, as the economy as a whole is measured on the GE. Where the two curves meet is called the <strong>equilibrium</strong>, where price and quantity have no tendency to change.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osrsecon-1024x359.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-478" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osrsecon-1024x359.jpg 1024w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osrsecon-300x105.jpg 300w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osrsecon-768x269.jpg 768w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osrsecon-830x291.jpg 830w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osrsecon-230x81.jpg 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osrsecon-350x123.jpg 350w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osrsecon-480x168.jpg 480w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/osrsecon.jpg 1230w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The entire economy of RuneScape is realistic due to supply and demand. Predictions about prices can be made based on increases or decreases in supply, or other determinants of supply, as well as the determinants of demand. </p>



<p>Even price controls are set by the NPC-owned stores in the game. If you would like to learn more about the economy of RuneScape, particularly about supply and demand, there is a dedicated page on the official wiki for it:  <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Economy">https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Economy</a> </p>



<h3>Economic Systems</h3>



<p>Lastly (at least for the basics), we should ask how real life economic systems compare to that of RuneScape&#8217;s economy. What type of economic system does RuneScape use? To answer this question, we have to consider the three main types of economic systems, including the theoretical.</p>



<ol><li> Command economy: Everything is owned by the government, and all decisions are made by a central planning board. </li><li>Laissez-faire or Free market economy: Government plays no role in the economy and everything is decided by the market interactions between buyers and sellers.</li><li>Mixed economy: Balance between market interactions and government intervention.</li></ol>



<p>These economic systems are used as a means of answering the three economic questions of (1) What goods and services should be produced? (2) How should these goods and services be produced? and (3) Who will get these goods and services?</p>



<p>First of all, a laissez-faire economy has never existed in real life, as the government of any nation has always played some role in its economy. However, RuneScape is a game, so we have to consider the possibility. At the same time, Jagex can always change things about a market by introducing new items or even altering prices if certain bugs occur with the Grand Exchange. It&#8217;s unlikely that even in a videogame that a laissez-faire economy can truthfully exist.</p>



<p>A command economy, which has existed in the real world, like the Soviet Union and Communist China, nowhere near fits the description of the economy of RuneScape. Jagex does not decide anything regarding the GE on a daily basis, nor do they own everything. Though it&#8217;s possible through their moderator powers to take everything in the game for their own, there is no value held in the items taken away from the population of players. So RuneScape does not function with a command economy.</p>



<p>The mixed economy might be more of what RuneScape runs on. There is certainly government intervention in the economy, as new items being introduced and price changes are in the hands of Jagex, though uncommonly done. </p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>So what does RuneScape offer that a high school economics course doesn&#8217;t? Not much, really. However, the game is a surprisingly strong asset for learning economics if played and understood prior to taking a course in economics. </p>



<p>But I think RuneScape teaches beyond the economic world. As a child, I learned to make decisions by conducting intuitive marginal analysis, how to make friends, how to type, and interestingly enough, how to utilize a computer, a tool that you must know how to operate in this day and age.</p>



<p>And the question that I posed itself leads to an even more important life lesson: Ask questions, especially the weird ones. </p>
