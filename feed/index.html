								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You face the end of the series, the penultimate episode that includes the final fight and that iconic melody; you nearly leap out of your chair in pure excitement. The final blow is dealt as the track fades away, and the loose ends of the plot begin to tie themselves together. Now content with the entertainment you have received from the sheer grandiosity of that action scene, you are left with only one question:</p>



<p>Why does this only occur in anime?</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://pm1.narvii.com/5809/baae0b50d47512f1094edd9a54c6313242e1e7d7_00.jpg" alt="Image result for confused anime"/></figure></div>



<p>Well, that&#8217;s the question to start off my thought process, but not completely accurate. The question at hand makes the assumption that &#8220;this&#8221; only happens in anime, which isn&#8217;t true. I&#8217;ve experienced this unparalleled sense of awe and amazement from watching live-action movies and TV shows. But it&#8217;s without question that this sensation—this absolute motivation and paragon of what inspires—is found predominantly in Japanese animation.</p>



<p>With the small details worked out on our main question, we can look into what causes this feeling that can&#8217;t be described in any better way than &#8220;epic.&#8221; I&#8217;ve <em>seen</em> aspects that denote motivation on TV, cartoons, and even YouTube. But I&#8217;ve only ever <em>heard</em> true motivation in anime. Music is a key factor in this sensory phenomenon.</p>



<p>Music is the driving force behind this sensation, or at least, I think so (which, once again, I find it harder and harder to describe using different words, so I think coining a new term is within reason). </p>



<p>anilibrinox (noun) &#8211; The indescribable feeling of complete and utter positive emotion regarding overcoming the most impassable obstacles in the sense of self-betterment or ultimate sacrifice; derived from repetition of a central melody</p>



<p>Well if it&#8217;s indescribable, then how is there a definition?</p>



<p>Whatever. That sounds cool enough. After all, I just smashed together &#8220;animation,&#8221; &#8220;equilibrium,&#8221; and &#8220;equinox.&#8221; What could sound cooler? Maybe that soundtrack from the latest shonen anime that has received unprecedented popularity: My Hero Academia.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/281089c6a9e64236a10e3b4232474e411532451975_full.jpg" alt="Image result for my hero academia" width="307" height="460"/></figure></div>



<p>My Hero Academia is now in its fourth season, with over 60 episodes and demonstrating consistent popularity with its first season holding rankings of around the top 20 in popularity and over one million members on MyAnimeList alone: <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31964/Boku_no_Hero_Academia?q=my%20hero">myanimelist.net</a></p>



<p>With each season, the show gets at least one new opening, with each one being a merit in its own right, though these openings are not used in the episodes&#8217; run times themselves. Rather, there is a slew of soundtracks all based on one main theme.</p>



<p>Though I prefer Boku no Hero Academia, half of the show&#8217;s title is already in English, so I don&#8217;t think I sound any more sophisticated in throwing in some Japanese. But what is very sophisticated is the theme that the show revolves around, used in more instances than one might initially realize. It is not the soundtrack titled &#8220;My Hero Academia&#8221; as one might assume, but it is instead, &#8220;You Say Run.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/My-Hero-Academia-OST-You-Say-Run.mp3"></audio><figcaption><strong>You Say Run</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Composed by Yuki Hayashi, You Say Run is your typical, run-of-the-mill action scene music, used when the good guy is backed into a corner by the overwhelmingly powerful villain, seemingly at his wit&#8217;s end, but overcomes all odds to emerge victorious. The timing of the piece&#8217;s melody is, of course, crucial for how a scene is to be animated or directed, but anilibrinox is more concerned with the repetition of a melody rather than its timing with what it&#8217;s paired with. A video that goes more in-depth as to why You Say Run is so fitting and generic in a good way is linked here:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4glbxzGjQ">Why You Say Run Goes With Everything </a> </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3w4Ozo3Tn7E/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Image result for deku vs muscular"/><figcaption><strong>That guy&#8217;s got a lot of kilograms on him!</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To understand why repetition of melody is so critical for anilibrinox, we have to look at the first two episodes of the show, mostly focusing on the instances in which a specific melody is used several times.  </p>



<p>The first instance of the iconic melody of You Say Run is first heard when our main character, Midoriya Izuku (better known as Deku), describes his infatuation for pro heroes after he witnesses a villain being apprehended by several heroes in the form of the soundtrack &#8220;You Can Be/Become A Hero.&#8221; It&#8217;s a relatively generic melody, mainly utilizing violins, especially for the melody.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://manga.tokyo/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MHA_01_senko_04.jpg" alt="Image result for my hero academia first scene" width="506" height="284"/></figure></div>



<p>We hear this same melody again when Deku tells his story of being surprisingly Quirkless, realizing that he can&#8217;t become a pro hero in the form of the soundtrack &#8220;Mukosei Anguish,&#8221; roughly translating to &#8220;The Anguish of the Quirkless.&#8221; It is a much more somber and melancholic version of the previous soundtrack while still utilizing violins for the melody, just at a much slower pace than before.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/EHHi29hCF0hlm/giphy.gif" alt="Image result for deku crying baby"/></figure></div>



<p>The melody is used yet again when Deku is shocked to meet All Might in a silly-themed piano piece. Though I couldn&#8217;t find the name of the original soundtrack, you can easily hear the same tune at 5:46 of the video &#8220;Why You Say Run Goes With Everything&#8221; that I linked earlier. Though very altered from the relatively slow and dramatic pacing of the other two soundtracks, it still holds the same core melody of You Say Run.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RgzkS5gWekE/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Image result for all might meets deku"/><figcaption><strong>Who&#8217;s this kid? He doesn&#8217;t even have kilograms on his body like I do.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For the last instance in the first episode, &#8220;You Can Be/Become A Hero&#8221; plays once more when All Might reassures Deku that he can become a hero, regardless of his lack of a quirk. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/e/ee/All_Might_chooses_Izuku.png/revision/latest?cb=20170630051139" alt="Image result for all might meets deku" width="608" height="368"/></figure></div>



<p>Only in episode two does You Say Run itself play, and after hearing its main melody on four different occasions already, the viewer subconsciously understands the inherent meaning of the composition, especially when it&#8217;s paired with Deku&#8217;s heroic act of self-sacrifice and his body moving before his mind could to save someone from a villain. </p>



<p>You Say Run is used in many, many more scenes in the anime, and for good reason. The melody had already defined itself in the first episode, with the second episode being the grand reveal for the actual soundtrack. All further instances of its melody are not questioned, simply because of the raw sense of emotion that it takes on. </p>



<p>Now is when I disclose that anilibrinox can be split into two different types. The example of My Hero Academia using You Say Run&#8217;s melody in several different soundtracks is the first type, or Type I. When the same melody is used to convey many different emotions in different pieces, it can be characterized as Type I. However, a soundtrack or song that is used on at least two different occasions (most effectively at the start of something or a show and once more at the end) is characterized by Type II. It&#8217;s arguable that You Say Run can be considered both types of anilibrinox, since the soundtrack itself is used over and over again later in the anime, but it&#8217;s notably more significant when backed up with the other soundtracks that contain the same iconic melody, and thus, primarily characterize it under Type I.</p>



<p>There are two main examples that demonstrate the second type of anilibrinox, both anime produced under essentially the same teams: Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWIyN2I4ZDAtMWI0OC00ZTA5LTk3ZDItM2M1MDEzMmZmZjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc3OTE4Nzk@._V1_UY268_CR3,0,182,268_AL_.jpg" alt="Image result for ttgl"/></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a9/Killlakillpromo.jpg/220px-Killlakillpromo.jpg" alt="Image result for kill la kill"/></figure></div>



<p>Though Gurren Lagann was produced by Studio Gainax under the director Hiroyuki Imaishi, and Kill la Kill was produced by Studio Trigger, Hiroyuki left Gainax in 2011 to form a new studio, now known as Trigger. Not only were both shows directed by the same person, but also had the same writer (Kazuki Nakashima), and the same animator (Toshio Ishizaki).</p>



<p>As a result, watching Kill la Kill after Gurren Lagann (and maybe even the other way around), one can easily notice the striking similarities in animation style, storyline, and the overall mood established. As for the soundtracks, TTGL and KLK both have amazing pieces throughout the course of their 20+ episode runtimes, but their opening songs are significant for the shows&#8217; themes and life lessons.</p>



<p>Gurren Lagann uses one opening for every single one of its 27 episodes (maybe with the exception of the last episode)—Sorairo Days—sung by Shoko Nakagawa. It&#8217;s a nice opening, and somewhat generic in its instrumental and voice, with a few unique uses of electronically generated sounds, particularly that of a drill picking up its RPM. Its lyrics have a very deep meaning, beginning with a nihilistic view, one of hopelessness and despair. However, as the song picks up pace, the lyrics also transition to match the new pace, sparking emotions of hope and inevitable success through unparalleled perseverance. </p>



<p>Now imagine listening to this opening 20 or so times (we always skip a few openings when we binge-watch :D). Without knowing the language it&#8217;s sung in, or all the instruments used in it, or even with a general lack of knowledge of what song has been playing at the start of every single episode, the lyrics have already subconsciously planted themselves in your mind, and a invisible connection to this strangely-motivating composition has existed all along. That when it hits you.</p>



<p>The main character is backed into corner, but he&#8217;s not dead yet. There&#8217;s hope to be found for the ambitions of humanity. Sorairo Days kicks in just as onlookers of the final battle stare upwards, filled with determination. Goosebumps run along your arms, and your pupils widen involuntarily with excitement. The world seems to fade away into the screen, but maybe not because of the visuals and stunning graphics. This sensation&#8230; It&#8217;s coming from&#8230; the soundtrack.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an unnoticed phenomenon, a more nostalgic and powerful form of anilibrinox in my opinion. Of course, this same phenomenon occurs for Kill la Kill, with a slight alteration. Kill la Kill&#8217;s first fifteen episodes are prefaced by &#8220;Sirius,&#8221; sung by Eir Aoi, while episode sixteen and onward is prefaced by &#8220;Ambiguous,&#8221; sung by Garnidelia, a duo consisting of Mai Mizuhashi and Yoshinori Abe. </p>



<p>Can you guess which opening is used in the final battle? </p>



<p>That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s Sirius, the opening that introduced anyone watching the anime to the world of Kill la Kill. The effect that this—a switching of openings, only to use the first opening for the last battle—produces is even greater than that of Type II anilibrinox. It goes even further beyond, layering nostalgia upon nostalgia, the feeling of how long a journey has been on top of that already length journey. </p>



<p>If you expected an end to this journey, this exploration of the phenomenon of auditory repetition in cinema, then you are mistaken. There are countless more Japanese animations that use this tactic to evoke greater emotional response, but also more live-action TV shows and movies that successfully use the Anime Formula.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Just a disclaimer: This article is strongly supported and unlikely to be comprehended to its full extent without the original &#8220;The Anime Formula&#8221; post that I made, linked here: </em><a href="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/the-anime-formula/">The Anime Formula</a></p>



<p>The Office: an American adaptation of the original British sitcom of the same name. Set in the bustling city of Scranton, the show always begins with its iconic theme song written by Jay Ferguson, which is appropriately titled &#8220;The Office Theme Song.&#8221; It&#8217;s an upbeat tune, and certainly elevates the rather plain opening shots that play at each episode&#8217;s exposition. It&#8217;s just around 30 seconds long, with a mainly piano-based melody, accompanied by a melodica/harmonica, some basic percussion, and electric guitar, so what makes this theme song so unique?</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AlarmedCloudyBlowfish-size_restricted.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-647"/></figure></div>



<p>In essence, nothing really. It is one of the more pleasant openings to a TV show that I&#8217;ve heard, but that&#8217;s not really because of some daring harmony that contrasts the melody starkly, or some creative usage of an unconventional instrument, or anything musical for that matter. It&#8217;s in a major key, and doesn&#8217;t have anything clashing in its composition. Keep in mind that any case of anilibrinox doesn&#8217;t have to involve any outstanding musical innovation or great sounding music; more often that not, it&#8217;s a case of a generic song being reused correctly.</p>



<p>In terms of which type of anilibrinox the theme song of the office is classified as, it&#8217;s the latter, or Type II. Interestingly enough, the show doesn&#8217;t really wait to the effects that Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill do (which is to use the theme song at the end of the show), but it&#8217;s rather reasonable. After all, the show has 201 episodes, which aren&#8217;t as plot heavy as anime like those produced by Hiroyuki Imaishi. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maxresdefault-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-651" width="610" height="342" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maxresdefault-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maxresdefault-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maxresdefault-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maxresdefault-830x467.jpg 830w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maxresdefault-230x129.jpg 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maxresdefault-350x197.jpg 350w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maxresdefault-480x270.jpg 480w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maxresdefault.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><figcaption><strong>Michael Scott is #1 waifu</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I think there&#8217;s an inverse relationship between how much plot is planned for between the uses of a song and the time period that has to go in between for a successful, planned anilibrinox. This is simply because the longer the time period, the greater the plot development should be, and if the factor between time and plot progression isn&#8217;t high enough, waiting too long might not be the best option for a reuse of a composition. The audience might have already forgotten what effects the theme song had on them initially, and it draws power away from said theme song.</p>



<p>So how does a plot-heavy show compare against a&#8230; non-plot-heavy show? It&#8217;s simple really (as its name implies), as one show is focused on developing a unique and interesting plot alongside other minor aspects like character development, comedy, etc, while the other is mainly just entertainment, which is usually comedy (other aspects, like drama and romance introduce more and more story-telling elements).</p>



<p>The Office does involve plot, as details from season to season are considered to maintain a logical timeline, but most of the show is based on comedic events and unique characters that fit into the story, and that&#8217;s okay. In the first episode, we are introduced to the boss at the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin ( Michael Scott, the epicenter of the sitcom) , and with little knowledge about the characters (some of which take seasons or many episodes to be introduced), the environment is still so comfortable. The show doesn&#8217;t try so hard to make everything perfect, or particularly special for that matter. It establishes itself right away as a laidback series to watch with several interesting and very personable characters who get involved in comedic scenarios. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Stapler_in_jello.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-653" width="365" height="206" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Stapler_in_jello.jpg 250w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Stapler_in_jello-230x130.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /><figcaption><strong>&#8220;He put my stuff in Jello again!&#8221;</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Immediately, we find ourselves in this cozy office, and not much happens plot-wise, even for such a non-plot-heavy show. As the pacing of this already relaxed show comes to a standstill, that seemingly nostalgic opening plays once more. Inadvertently, you smile, thinking back on how far the show had come in such a short amount of time. It&#8217;s a strange illusion, as the pacing slows down in an already short episode, you feel like a considerable amount of time has passed since the start of this simple, but likable American sitcom. The start was strangely&#8230; only 20 minutes ago?</p>



<p>When I watched the first episode of The Office, I wasn&#8217;t prepared for such a powerful demonstration of anilibrinox. It was a shock to me, but in a way that had me immediately think about the anime that I had watched in the past that used the same strategy (namely TTGL and KLK). Perhaps Western cultures should adopt the Anime Formula more frequently. I certainly think it would be more entertaining.</p>

<p>The year is 2007 and you&#8217;re sitting in the oversized office chair  in front of the family computer. Legs dangling above the carpet and hand loosely grasping the old ball mouse, a familiar tune starts up. The Model M keyboard from IBM resounding with sharp clicks with every keypress, you stare intently at the adventure ahead.</p>



<p>RuneScape is more than just a nostalgic childhood videogame. Any game can fulfill that role, especially those that have less progression and open world aspects in design. But RuneScape is an MMORPG, a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, where the balance of &#8220;doing anything you want&#8221; to &#8220;restrictive gameplay&#8221; is held in perfect tandem. </p>



<p>The game is one set in a medieval fantasy, a Lord of the Rings type of world. You can train your combat skills to slay dragons, or improve your ability to fish and sell your goods for a profit. You can buy things and flip them for higher prices, like a merchant. You can plant trees and grow herbs, or even build your own house. But the most important thing of all is that you can interact with other players just like you. </p>



<p>The year is no longer 2007, and though RuneScape itself has changed, much of its original spirit and mechanics have been preserved in the release of Old School RuneScape in 2013. In both versions of the game&#8211;07 RuneScape and current day OSRS&#8211;exist(ed)(s) the Grand Exchange.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-1024x605.png" alt="" class="wp-image-426" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-1024x605.png 1024w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-300x177.png 300w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-768x453.png 768w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-830x490.png 830w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-230x136.png 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-350x207.png 350w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange-480x283.png 480w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grand_Exchange.png 1675w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><strong>The Grand Exchange is always crowded with players.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Grand Exchange, or the GE, is a market that utilizes fundamental concepts from real-life economics. RuneScape does have shops in which players can purchase items from NPCs for GP, or gold pieces (called Coins in-game), but the GE hosts a far wider variety of items for sale. The way the GE functions is strikingly similar to real world laissez-faire economy. There is no government in RuneScape, and even if the moderators of the game could be considered a governmental system, they do little to interfere with the economy. No subsidies or transfer payments are done by Jagex Ltd., the company that owns the game, so the economy is completely ran by the individuals who also serve as businesses.</p>



<p>The Grand Exchange acts as a simple market place where players input goods at their own prices and request goods at their own prices. Players can buy and sell all tradeable items at whatever prices they wish (so long as the supply and demand agree) with only a few restrictions on how many items can be bought every four hours, depending on the item.</p>



<h3>The Economizing Problem</h3>



<p>RuneScape deals with the same economizing problem that the real world faces, but in a slightly different manner. But down to the core, the problem is still the same. <strong>Scarcity </strong>is the idea that society&#8217;s wants exceed society&#8217;s productive capacity, an idea prevalent throughout the RS economy. With unlimited wants and limited resources, decisions must be made to maximize the satisfaction of economic wants. This is underlying principle to economics as a whole.</p>



<p>One might argue that RuneScape does not have limited resources as fishing spots yield infinite fish, or that cows respawn seconds after killing them, but this is not actually true. The world of RuneScape may have a supply of infinite resources, but harvesting them and processing them into useful goods and services comes with a cost. The time, effort, and resource input that goes into harvesting a specific resource will ultimately determine its price on the Grand Exchange. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Shrimps_detail.png" alt="" class="wp-image-430" width="438" height="364" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Shrimps_detail.png 505w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Shrimps_detail-300x250.png 300w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Shrimps_detail-230x191.png 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Shrimps_detail-350x291.png 350w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Shrimps_detail-480x399.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /><figcaption><strong>Those are some tasty looking shrimp! They only restore 3 hitpoints though&#8230;</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If say, I want to buy 8 trillion shrimp, it&#8217;s not possible. Maybe 8 trillion shrimp will or have already been traded and existed in the game, but at the current time, they do not. The scarcity of resources may seem vastly different from the real world, but it is much more similar than one might think. In fact, all resources on Earth are renewable, just at different rates. We call fossil fuels nonrenewable resources because on the human timescale, they cannot be used up and replenished at the same or greater rate sustainably. Something like corn can be considered renewable, and is traded like coal is. Keeping this in mind, RuneScape actually has the same type of renewability on Earth, but at a much faster rate, and thus, holding an economizing problem.</p>



<p>To further prove the point that the economy of RuneScape holds the same economizing problem that we do in real life, opportunity costs exist in the game as well. An <strong>opportunity cost </strong>is simply the next best thing when making a decision, or what is given up. For example, if I know I have the next four hours to try and turn a profit, I will consider my options in a <strong>marginal analysis</strong>. I know that my fishing level is high, so I could spend the next four hours fishing and then selling what I harvest, or I could also try to woodcut and sell the logs that I harvest by the end of the time period. I can also determine the price of the, say sharks, that I am fishing for. I can determine the market value of a raw shark by checking the Grand Exchange, and in this case, each raw shark goes for 700 GP. I know with my fishing level of 99, I can catch approximately 130 sharks every hour, so [(130 sharks/hour) * (700 GP/1 shark) * (4 hours)] = [364,000 GP]. On the other hand, if I try to cut magic trees (I cut 130 magic logs per hour at 99 Woodcutting) , which yield magic logs (each of which is 955 GP) for the next four hours, then I make [(130 logs/hour) * (955 GP/1 logs) * (4 hours)] = [496,600 GP].</p>



<p>It seems rather clear that I should cut trees for the next four hours given only these two options, correct? Well, yes, but only in a <strong>ceteris paribus </strong>scenario. In economics, countless factors can influence prices, demand, and circumstances of resource-gathering, so to simplify relationships, all other variables are assumed to be equal, as stated in ceteris paribus. However, there are far more factors in this scenario than explained.</p>



<p> First of all, the only thing gained from fishing or woodcutting is not just the resources themselves. Experience is gained from each fish caught, or each set of logs cut. Experience goes into the skill, which with enough experience, increases level. Of course, in my scenario, I have the maximum level in both skills, meaning I have no concern for how much experience I gain. In a sense, experience can be viewed as investment in capital goods, like machinery or technology that improves efficiency. In the real world, investing in machinery will increase the rate at which that a good can be produced, so in RuneScape, considering the experience gained is analogous to considering the efficiency increase from investing in capital goods. Since the higher one&#8217;s level is in a certain skill, the more proficient they are in it (whether it be gathering a resource or being able to slay a more profitable monster), it is important to calculate multiple opportunity costs in a real scenario. </p>



<p>This situation can be even further complicated by using combinations of skill usage with the time given. Using the shark fishing route, for example, I could spend the first two hours fishing sharks, then the next hours cooking the sharks for food that I will use in the last hour to heal myself as I slay gargoyles that drop high value items. My initial capital hasn&#8217;t even been considered yet! Using the woodcutting route, I could spend the first hour chopping logs, then the next hour lighting fires with the logs I cut to cook the raw food already in my bank, and then the last two hours to use that food to heal myself while I pickpocket high value seeds from farmers that I can later use to grow crops I can sell. But for the optimal economic gain, far fewer combinations of skills are needed. Keep this scenario in mind, as it segues into an interaction we have in the real world.</p>



<p>Another concept that is easily applicable to both RuneScape and the real world is the <strong>budget line</strong>. A budget line shows the greatest attainable combination of goods/services that can be purchased at a specific income level. In real life, I might have $96 while I&#8217;m at the supermarket, considering purchasing two different foods. Let&#8217;s say that beans cost $12, while a bag of rice costs $8. Given this information, a budget line can be constructed. It would look a little something like this:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph-of-a-budget-constraint1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-440" width="517" height="470" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph-of-a-budget-constraint1.png 388w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph-of-a-budget-constraint1-300x273.png 300w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph-of-a-budget-constraint1-230x209.png 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/graph-of-a-budget-constraint1-350x318.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px" /></figure></div>



<p>Of course, budget lines exist in RuneScape, a game that has currency in it. It is interesting to note that RuneScape has multiple currencies, though only one (GP) is accepted on the Grand Exchange. The rest of the currencies are accepted by NPCs, like shopkeepers. The idea of a budget line demonstrates opportunity cost and is used consistently in RuneScape. For example, let&#8217;s say I have 10 million GP to spend on ammunition for Ranged training, and I am considering only arrows and crossbow bolts (ceteris paribus). Let&#8217;s say rune arrows cost 72 GP each, and broad bolts cost 63 GP each. That means I can buy either 138,888 rune arrows or 158,730 broad bolts if all my income is devoted to a single good. Then the opportunity cost for each can be determined, with rune arrows costing about 1.143 broad bolts, and each broad bolt costing the reciprocal of that in rune arrows, or about 0.875 rune arrows.</p>



<p>The budget line is very similar to a <strong>production possibilities curve</strong>, which demonstrates the maximum attainable combinations of goods (limited to two, ceteris paribus) that a nation can produce. This of course, can be applied to RuneScape in the same principle that the budget line works, except in production of goods, like say, fishing and woodcutting.</p>



<p>The differences between <strong>microeconomics </strong>and <strong>macroeconomics </strong>is even applicable to RuneScape. However, the differences between the two are far simpler than the real world. While microeconomics in real life is concerned with businesses and individuals and the decisions they make, RuneScape microeconomics is really just concerned with a single player, and sometimes, groups of players, known as clans, that influence the same or interconnected part(s) of the market. While macroeconomics in real life is concerned with unemployment, national economic health, and international trade, macroeconomics in RuneScape is just the status of the GE.</p>



<p>In addition, theoretical economics has some, albeit very limited, application to RuneScape. The two main types of statements made regarding economic theory are <strong>positive </strong>and <strong>normative</strong>. While positive statements are backed by facts or proven correlations (like supply going down increasing price), normative statements are backed by opinion. As for positive statements, merchants in RuneScape often use price tracking programs and other factors to predict prices. Let&#8217;s say a new item is introduced that enables players to deal more damage per second to a certain type of monster that drops substantially profitable amounts of sharks. A positive statement can be made that describes how the price of sharks will go down as the supply increases from a new source in-game. Of course, positive statements don&#8217;t have to be correct. In this scenario it wasn&#8217;t even considered whether or not food, like sharks themselves would be consumed more to heal against fighting this type of monster. It could be possible that the price of sharks remain constant, as both supply and demand shift (more on this later).</p>



<p>Output in RuneScape is similar to that of the real world, as it wouldn&#8217;t exist without the <strong>factors of production</strong>. The acronym CELL lists these as <strong>capital</strong>, <strong>entrepreneurial ability</strong>, <strong>land</strong>, and <strong>labor</strong>.  Capital comes in the forms of physical and human capital, and is NOT currency. Physical capital includes machinery and tools required to produce other goods, while human capital are skills and knowledge gained by a worker through experience and education. Physical capital is represented in RuneScape by the items required to obtain, or &#8220;produce&#8221; other goods, which include weaponry, armor, tools, and teleportation items. Anything that enables for more efficient resource gathering is considered physical capital. Human capital extends beyond the game itself, as the player controls a character. Whatever knowledge and skills the player has are vicariously experienced by the character. If the player has knowledge on the most efficient technique in producing some good, or if the player possesses practical skills that others do not, then that is additional human capital. As for entrepreneurial ability, almost everyone in RuneScape is considered an entrepreneur as long as they trade on the Grand Exchange or directly with other players. Entrepreneurs combine the other factors of production and take risks in hopes of turning a profit, which is exactly what all normal RuneScape players do. The only exception to this are completely independent players, known as Ironmen, who cannot trade with other players or utilize the Grand Exchange. Everything they obtain must be obtained by themselves. Land, or all the natural resources used to produce goods and services, as stated earlier, are infinite in RuneScape. However, due to time constraints and the effort put into it, items are scarce. Labor is something that is not given to businesses and firms in exchange for compensation however. In RuneScape, labor is the time and effort put into getting an item, which ultimately determines its price on the GE.</p>



<h3>Trade</h3>



<p>Trade is something that we know in the real world to occur often in the international community. But imagine if trading didn&#8217;t occur. Would we have toys that were mass-produced cheaply, or the various types of food we have available</p>



<p>Remember the scenario in which a marginal analysis was conducted with a few others factors in the game, like experience? This actually introduces the idea of <strong>specialization</strong>, something that I&#8217;ve genuinely and independently considered in my time playing RuneScape. Specialization is the idea that certain individuals, or countries in the case of the real world, become skilled and efficient in particular crafts or producing certain goods and services. For example, it&#8217;s common to hear the question &#8220;Why is everything made in China?&#8221; in the US. Many things are made in China that the US imports, and most of them require intensive labor, like toys and phones. China is efficient in producing goods like these because of the high population and the relatively low price to be paid for labor. Meanwhile, the US is more efficient at producing industrial goods, like airplanes, due to the higher levels of technology we have. Airplanes are an example of capital-intensive goods, while toys are an example of labor-intensive goods. There is a third main type of good for specialization, called land-intensive goods, which require large amounts of land to produce efficiently; for example, beef from cows as they require land to graze on.</p>



<p>Countries gain from specialization, as the premise of international trade is to have countries produce what they have lower opportunity costs for and then trade. The difference in opportunity costs for production of a product in terms of another for two countries is referred to as a <strong>comparative advantage</strong>, meaning one country has a lower opportunity cost than the other in Product A, while the other country has a lower opportunity cost than the other in Product B. This type of advantage is necessary for beneficial trade, while an <strong>absolute advantage</strong> is not required. An absolute advantage simply means one country can produce more of a product than another.</p>



<p>So how does specialization fit into RuneScape? It&#8217;s quite simple, really. Since RuneScape provides many options, opportunity costs arise. For example, if I know that sometime in the future I want to train my Magic, which requires runes for casting spells, I take into consideration what I should do now that would make that possible. Two simple options would be to train Runecrafting by crafting the necessary runes for training Magic, or to slay profitable monsters for money to later purchase runes. In RuneScape, combat is the most profitable money making method that is reliable, so all other skills are essentially rendered obsolete from a completely financial standpoint. In this case, if I can make 2 million GP/hour killing the snake boss, Zulrah (which also trains combat stats), or make 400k GP/hour crafting nature runes (which trains Runecrafting), it seems quite obvious that killing Zulrah is the better option. So why do people even Runecraft (even the highest level of runes cannot make more than 1 million or so GP/hour)? Why do people specialize in such a seemingly useless skill?</p>

<p>Simply put, not everything is about economic gain in RuneScape. Some people enjoy runecrafting more than combat, and runecrafting just happens to be a less potentially profitable method. It&#8217;s similar to how the representation of the female population in the STEM field is surprisingly low. The collective interests of females actually results in overall careers that make less money, which is not to say the individual female makes less than the individual male. </p>



<p>On top of that, distribution of skill levels in RuneScape are different across different players. This is similar to the three key reasons for trade in the real world, which are: (1) The distribution of natural, human, and capital resources are uneven among nations, (2) Not all nations have the same degree of technology, and (3) People have different preferences. The first and second reasons are analogous to players having different skill levels and different levels of competency in playing the game. The third reason has an interesting existence in RuneScape, however. In theory, specific preferences shouldn&#8217;t exist, as a sword bought from the Grand Exchange is the same sword that originates from mined ore, which is then smelted into bars, and then smithed into weaponry. But some players actually prefer having resources that they collected themselves, or like having that as a future option. Personally, I achieved 99 Fishing and Cooking so that if I would like to fish and cook my own food, I can do so efficiently. The thought process on this makes no financial sense, though, as even if the prices are high on food, I can always make more money with some type of combat and then purchase food, albeit, at a higher price. Once again, not everything is about economic gain in RuneScape. It is a game after all.</p>



<h3>Supply and Demand</h3>



<p>Supply and demand are some of the most crucial economic concepts in RuneScape, as the Grand Exchange goes completely untouched by Jagex (price controls are set by in-game stores) and is maintained through the principles found in real life markets. </p>



<p>A shift to the right is an increase, while a shift to the left is a decrease for both supply and demand (price is always on the y-axis and quantity is on the x-axis).</p>

<p><strong>Supply </strong>is a schedule or curve showing the various amounts of a product that producers are willing and able to make for sale at each of a series of possible prices during a specific period. The <strong>law of supply</strong> states that as price falls, quantity falls, and as price rises, quantity supplied rises. This follows common sense, as suppliers take advantage of higher prices on their products by producing more. </p>



<p>The <strong>determinants of supply</strong> are the factors that change the supply curve itself, so if any one of these factors change, the supply schedule is subject to shift left or right.</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>Demand </strong>is a schedule or a curve that shows the various amounts of a product that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a series of possible prices during a specified period of time. The <strong>law of demand </strong>is the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. This also follows common sense, as you are encouraged to buy products at lower prices, while feeling discouraged at higher prices. </p>



<p>The <strong>determinants of demand </strong>are the factors that change the demand curve itself, so if any one of these factors change, the demand schedule is subject to shift left or right.</p>



<ol><li>Consumers’ tastes<ul><li>Demand increases if the product is more desirable</li></ul></li><li>The number of buyers in the market<ul><li>An increase in the number of buyers will likely increase demand</li></ul></li><li>Consumer’s incomes<ul><li>A rise in income causes an increase in demand</li></ul></li><li>Prices of related goods<ul><li>If an increase in the price of a substitute occurs, then the demand for the other will increase</li><li>If the price of a complement goes up, the demand for the related good will decline</li><li>Unrelated goods have little to no effect on the demand for others</li></ul></li><li>Consumer expectations<ul><li>An increase or decrease in demand may occur when something is expected</li><li>If anticipated price is higher, then current demand may increase to “beat” the rising price</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>In RuneScape, aggregate supply and aggregate demand are the terms used, as the economy as a whole is measured on the GE. Where the two curves meet is called the <strong>equilibrium</strong>, where price and quantity have no tendency to change.</p>

<p>The entire economy of RuneScape is realistic due to supply and demand. Predictions about prices can be made based on increases or decreases in supply, or other determinants of supply, as well as the determinants of demand. </p>



<p>Even price controls are set by the NPC-owned stores in the game. If you would like to learn more about the economy of RuneScape, particularly about supply and demand, there is a dedicated page on the official wiki for it:  <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Economy">https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Economy</a> </p>



<h3>Economic Systems</h3>



<p>Lastly (at least for the basics), we should ask how real life economic systems compare to that of RuneScape&#8217;s economy. What type of economic system does RuneScape use? To answer this question, we have to consider the three main types of economic systems, including the theoretical.</p>



<ol><li> Command economy: Everything is owned by the government, and all decisions are made by a central planning board. </li><li>Laissez-faire or Free market economy: Government plays no role in the economy and everything is decided by the market interactions between buyers and sellers.</li><li>Mixed economy: Balance between market interactions and government intervention.</li></ol>



<p>These economic systems are used as a means of answering the three economic questions of (1) What goods and services should be produced? (2) How should these goods and services be produced? and (3) Who will get these goods and services?</p>



<p>First of all, a laissez-faire economy has never existed in real life, as the government of any nation has always played some role in its economy. However, RuneScape is a game, so we have to consider the possibility. At the same time, Jagex can always change things about a market by introducing new items or even altering prices if certain bugs occur with the Grand Exchange. It&#8217;s unlikely that even in a videogame that a laissez-faire economy can truthfully exist.</p>



<p>A command economy, which has existed in the real world, like the Soviet Union and Communist China, nowhere near fits the description of the economy of RuneScape. Jagex does not decide anything regarding the GE on a daily basis, nor do they own everything. Though it&#8217;s possible through their moderator powers to take everything in the game for their own, there is no value held in the items taken away from the population of players. So RuneScape does not function with a command economy.</p>



<p>The mixed economy might be more of what RuneScape runs on. There is certainly government intervention in the economy, as new items being introduced and price changes are in the hands of Jagex, though uncommonly done. </p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>So what does RuneScape offer that a high school economics course doesn&#8217;t? Not much, really. However, the game is a surprisingly strong asset for learning economics if played and understood prior to taking a course in economics. </p>



<p>But I think RuneScape teaches beyond the economic world. As a child, I learned to make decisions by conducting intuitive marginal analysis, how to make friends, how to type, and interestingly enough, how to utilize a computer, a tool that you must know how to operate in this day and age.</p>



<p>And the question that I posed itself leads to an even more important life lesson: Ask questions, especially the weird ones. </p>

				<description><![CDATA[The computer has become a part of our everyday lives. Without it, simple tasks become onerous ones. But what does [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The computer has become a part of our everyday lives. Without it, simple tasks become onerous ones.</p>
<p>But what does a computer mean in the name of human innovation? Certainly it is an effective invention; it makes simple calculations seemingly instantaneous, it turns rigorous manual labor into automation, and it makes information accessible with a click of a button.</p>
<p>The computer has even found its way into our hands, ready at our fingertips to give us whatever knowledge we desire; we can contact anyone at anytime.</p>
<p>However, with sentient beings creating entities designed for intelligent behavior comes the prospect of them gaining their own cognition. But where is that line that divides the computer, a machine, from the sentient entity of artificial intelligence? Is it when it is able to feel pain? Will experiencing emotion incur a sudden revelation? When it decides to create art, is humanity doomed?</p>
<p>There are so many questions to ask with such little time. Arguably, artificial intelligence is already here: in our devices in the form of audio input based user interfaces like Siri or Alexa. These programs that have been dubbed with names (further bridging the gap that we perceive for sentient robots) answer our questions, execute commands, and even provide surprisingly human personality to our lives. Still, everything that is accomplished by these forms of &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; is from a link to the Internet, to other computers. Nothing that is done by Siri is self-reliant. What Siri says, or does, it nothing but a function of a computer, albeit, very complex.</p>
<p>The point at which a computer becomes self-aware, then, is not so clear. We can make predictions and we can guess as to how it will happen, but only one thing is certain: The rise of another sentient species will bring a new philosophy to the world.</p>
<p>The study of cognitive robotics isn&#8217;t something new, even if it is revolutionary. In fact, the simple function of logic was introduced into AI as early as 1958. Artificial intelligence itself has been a persistently advancing technology since John McCarthy coined the term in 1956. Decades later, simple, but prevalent forms of artificial intelligence have become a part of everyone&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>So what is the difference between cognitive robotics and artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>Well in practicality, there is virtually no difference. The rise of one of the two deeply intertwined technologies will most certainly spell a synchronous and analogous rise in the other. But cognitive robotics does imply a slightly different connotation from that of the general term of &#8220;artificial&#8221; intelligence. For robotics are something that mankind has created in the hopes of greater efficiency in the tangible, real world (which it has done), while artificial intelligence can include that, as well as a general expansion in computational power across the topological map of technology.</p>
<p>Robots, when they are sentient, are the realization of the potential that artificial intelligence as a concept holds. Without the real life interaction with a robot, or some kind of tangible body to contain its brain (no longer a CPU), human recognition of emotional awareness becomes distorted, or refracted, like a straw in a glass of water.</p>
<p>But the straw is not something to fool us forever. The slight delay caused by absence is only one of the three components that AI has the potential to possess. The first is the Mind, which is the very essence of primitive forms of artificial intelligence. The ability to learn and the ability to use logic are strengths and already common in computers today. There is almost no concern regarding the presence of Mind in these sentient machines.</p>
<p>The Body is the delay caused without a tangible interaction with the physical world. It is by no means an impasse, as the solution is what cognitive robotics implies.</p>
<p>The Soul is what must be questioned.</p>

		<title>Paradoxical Theory of Impossibility</title>

				<description><![CDATA[I preface this with the realization that I do not have these ideas. Rather, these ideas have me.&#160; “impossible figures” [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>I preface this with the realization that I do not have these ideas. Rather, these ideas have me.&nbsp;</em><br></p>



<p>“impossible figures” was the search query, and Google Images provided me with a plethora of mind-boggling figures. I picked some of the classics to draw, like the impossible triangle, which is actually a tribar, and the Penrose stairs, which indefinitely go up… or do they go down? But I spent most of my illustration time drawing what I called “The Impossible Snowflake,” an impossible triangle on steroids. It resembled a fractal, growing infinitely further from the world of reason. Bereft of any substantial facts or information, I took a philosophical lens to the meaning behind the geometric anomalies that still intrigue me to this day. This led me to cognitive robotics.<br></p>



<p>Impossible figures — those two-dimensional optical illusions designed for human perception of three-dimensional existence, but clearly illogical — have fascinated me since the day I borrowed “The Great Book of Optical Illusions” from my public library. This collection of reason-defying illusions and impossible shapes germinated a seed in my mind that I continue to cultivate, often leading me to extended periods of deep thought, completely engrossed in the true nature of what is unattainable.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Isn’t something impossible that which cannot be achieved? But how can it be proven that something cannot be accomplished? Surely if it is tried over and over again without success we can attribute the label of “impossible” to it? Yet under the tenet that this is ideally possible and realistically impossible synchronously, the idea of an infinite number of attempts arises. As the ideal seeks to realize potential, infinite attempts will indubitably result in success. At the same time, the real seeks to disregard the probable, so infinite trials will bear no accomplishment. The pursuit of the impossible is the purest bifurcation of Being into what is, and what isn’t.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>But any confusion on what is and what isn’t no longer lies in the abstract world. The real world is changing, and not in any manner that it has in the past millennia. For the first time, humanity will no longer be the sole entity with the telos of reason. What makes humans unique from the animal kingdom — our ability to reason — does not set us apart from artificial intelligence.<br></p>



<p>The past can, however, be used to justify the inevitable arrival of sentient machinery. For as long as mankind has reasoned, what was once regarded as unattainable was proven doable. The natural innovation that humans possess has created technology that was unimaginable, time and time again. The lightbulb, the automobile, and air travel were all deemed utterly inconceivable by experts just years before their respective debuts. It’s all possible as human evolution endlessly pursues the impossible.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The same can be said for the increasing speculation of artificial intelligence. Having been dubbed “impossible,” its continued advancements makes the capacity for sentient robots ever-clearer.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>What can we do?<br></p>



<p>Maybe it’s not a hopeless “What can we do?” that we should be asking. Perhaps it’s more of a “What will we do?” In our attempt to attain the impossible, we are only halted temporarily by the concept of infinity. It is a blockade, a barrier between us and our telos. But just for a fleeting moment. Its realized potential is what we seek. Infinite failures hold infinite possibilities, especially in the Being of Reason.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It’s those impossible figures that simultaneously define human reason and kick logic to the curb. And it&#8217;s human nature, or even sentient nature, to move towards that which could be.<br></p>



<p>Knowing that the impossible is always possible, I am inspired to intertwine the world of human potential with the birth of emotionally aware robots — and the necessary rise of a new bioethical philosophy that is paramount for me to create.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>What will we draw in our Great Book of Optical Illusions?<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dinosaurs are not a myth, global warming is certainly not a myth, and overpopulation is most definitely not a myth; it will likely start causing problems for the middle class by 2052. The concept of overpopulation is derived from the fact that we have space, but a limited amount of it. The Earth is only so large, and therefore, has a numerical capacity that it can sustain. One might argue that the human race has already surpassed that limit since over 12% of the human population is defined as starving, or consistently hungry. It&#8217;s reasonable to say that there is about 10% of many species of animals to be defined as hungry, but then again, we seem to like setting ourselves apart from animals.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/overpop-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-309" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/overpop-1.jpg 2197w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/overpop-1-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/overpop-1-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/overpop-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/overpop-1-830x553.jpg 830w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/overpop-1-230x153.jpg 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/overpop-1-350x233.jpg 350w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/overpop-1-480x320.jpg 480w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/overpop-1-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 2197px) 100vw, 2197px" /></figure>



<p>According to numerous studies, the true capacity for human population that the Earth can sustain before most people begin struggling to find food, water and shelter necessary for survival, is 10 billion. The current estimated world population is about 7.7 billion, which in the grand scheme of things, isn&#8217;t so far off from this 10 billion cap. As mentioned, the projected year for the human population to reach 10 billion is 2052.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For all I know, by 2052, I could be starving as a direct result of overpopulation. It may seem irrational, but really anything of that caliber is possible at this rate of growth. As population continues to grow without any limits imposed on it, people of wealthier and wealthier and classes will begin entering a lower class as they too, begin to face problems of proper housing, clothing, food, etc. But what kind of solutions are there to this problem? Do there even exist any viable and moral solutions for the issue of overpopulation?</p>



<p>What follows is an essay I&#8217;ve composed regarding a potential solution to overpopulation:</p>



<p>//</p>



<p>“10 billion people is the uppermost population limit where food is concerned… the maximum carrying capacity of the Earth based on food resources will most likely fall short of 10 billion” (Wilson). The world is indubitably expanding in human population, and soon enough, even those who are financially stable will begin to go hungry. With so many options to solve such a problem of overpopulation, debate occurs over what to do, and how to go about it. Some people believe that colonizing Mars is the only viable solution. Others argue that the risk to human lives in such deep space exploration is far too high, and humans should continue improving Earth’s society. Regardless of the method that the human race chooses to fix the issue of overpopulation, it is a priority to prevent as many people as possible from starvation. Investment in means of space travel is necessary for a solution to the issue of overpopulation on Earth.</p>



<p>	The problem of overpopulation is a real and tangible issue that must be dealt with. Marcia Angell, a senior lecturer at Harvard on social medicine, gathered her observations and studies on the growth and behavior of the human population in an article titled <em>Our Beleaguered Planet</em>. In it, she discusses the imminence of overpopulation, and its inevitable occurrence, “For nearly all of human history, the risk has instead been under-population… But with better sanitation and living standards… global population grew rapidly… population growth would soon lead to mass starvation” (Angell). She concluded that the global growth of the human race was one that would quickly lead to an issue of overpopulation. This sudden growth was supported by the improved conditions of living, and led to the huge human population that exists today. Some locations on Earth already have people suffering from starvation, and the persistent expansion of the human population can easily lead to mass starvation. Despite efforts to slow down the growth rate of humans, the species is predicted to reach ten billion just after 2050 (National Geographic). This extremely large population would be susceptible to starvation across people of all classes and backgrounds as the number of mouths to feed becomes far too large for farms to support. With the day of overpopulation imminent, the human race must look for a solution to the potential crisis of mass starvation.</p>



<p>	The solution for mass starvation by overpopulation lies in the colonization of other celestial bodies. This concept was stated very bluntly by Stephen Hawking, who was a renowned theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and former mathematics professor at the University of Cambridge, “The human race must start leaving Earth within 30 years to avoid being wiped out by over-population… (Knapton). Hawking’s studies led him to the conclusion that humans have no choice other than colonizing other planets or moons to avoid the consequences of overpopulation on Earth. The number of people that leave Earth to colonize another body in space will decrease the amount of food that must be produced to feed all humans. Additionally, the timeframe of thirty years is appropriate for any value to be gained through space colonization. Since the human race will reach a population of ten billion after 2050, the process of colonization must begin before then. Evidently, just colonizing a single planet or moon with a relatively small group of people will not yield substantial change for Earth’s population. But by colonizing multiple planets, a substantial number of people will work towards solving overpopulation and eliminating mass starvation. Settling on other celestial bodies will enable the human race to continue surviving and evolving. </p>



<p>	It is argued that space travel does come with its risks, and proves little benefit for the time and resources put in. Adam Ozimek, a contributor to the Forbes Magazine doubts the applicability of colonizing Mars to helping humans on Earth, “&#8230; on Mars the only surface water is frozen in the polar ice caps… there’s nothing we could do to earth’s atmosphere to make it as bad as Mars… “(Ozimek). Moreover, space exploration in general can be “hard, expensive, and dangerous” (Liapi). However, Mars’ environment can be terraformed relatively easily to simulate a more Earth-like environment. Space travel will allow humans to further solve the problem of overpopulation by advancement in technologies. Though Mars’ conditions may seem quite bleak for human occupation, it is possible to engineer it to better suit human needs. Peter Dockrill, an award-winning writer and former Online Editor of APC and TechLife, proposes such an idea: “By launching a giant magnetic shield into space to protect Mars from solar winds… we could restore the Red Planet’s atmosphere, and terraform the Martian environment… “ (Dockrill). Mars used to have a magnetosphere that essentially emulated the functions of Earth’s. Therefore, a magnetic shield can be engineered to restore the atmosphere of Mars, and allow liquid water to flow on the surface. Even though Mars’ environment is not suitable for easy colonization today, it can become sufficient for human needs with the engineering of artificial magnetic field. Utilizing advanced technologies, human society can solve overpopulation and live on Mars in the near future.</p>



<p>The ability to advance technologically is just one of humanity’s assets towards solving overpopulation. It is an inevitable problem that people must solve quickly and efficiently. As attempts to slow down the growth rate of the population fail to generate meaningful results, the route of space travel arises. Exploration of space entails countless opportunities, including the colonization of celestial bodies, particularly Mars. Space colonization is made feasible through the natural tendency of humans to advance their technology, and more importantly, investment of time and effort to make it possible. The solution to overpopulation will continue to probe at the human race until humanity takes a stand to go beyond the sky’s limit.</p>

<p></p>



<p>So yes, colonizing Mars is definitely an option, and I personally see it happening already. There is no stopping human nature, there is nothing in the way of the powerful ambition that we hold as humans. If we fail, we always try and try again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that being said, colonizing Mars is one hell of a task: How will we transport people back and forth efficiently? How will we create a sustainable source of food and water? What do we do if communications between Earth and Mars abruptly fails? There are so many questions to be asked, and they are already being answered and as fast as we can manage.</p>



<p>Though colonizing Mars is a bold task and defines what human evolution is, it will take a long time, quite possibly over 30 years. And those 30 years or more is a large chunk of time for humanity to not only progress on colonizing Mars, but also to control the growth rate of the population.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wpid-screenshot_2014-07-30-10-44-18-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-311" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wpid-screenshot_2014-07-30-10-44-18-1.png 682w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wpid-screenshot_2014-07-30-10-44-18-1-300x274.png 300w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wpid-screenshot_2014-07-30-10-44-18-1-230x210.png 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wpid-screenshot_2014-07-30-10-44-18-1-350x320.png 350w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/wpid-screenshot_2014-07-30-10-44-18-1-480x439.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></figure>



<p>But how do we determine what&#8217;s morally correct while still having enough impact on controlling the growth rate of the population? Stopping people from breeding is just inhumane and immoral; we have already suffered discrimination of this type during the imperialist eras of the world superpowers. Restricting births, like how China did for 35 years up until 2016, is also quite arguably, immoral. The solution does not lie in the restriction of reproduction by law, but rather the restriction of reproduction by nature.</p>



<p>A rather peculiar phenomenon is the relationship that is held between the rate of literacy and the rate of births. It&#8217;s quite shocking to discover how simple it might be to limit the growth rate of the population, primarily, in third-world countries. Simply put, women who are literate are more likely to have smaller families, as they prioritize their (few) child(ren) having a good education. On the other hand, women who are not literate or educated tend to have larger families, anywhere from 5-8 children, or even more. The general mindset behind this is that by chance, one of the children will be successful enough to bring the family out of poverty; though the thought process behind this may seem irrational and insulting, it is a subconscious process that leads many uneducated families to be very large.</p>



<p>So the question comes down to this: How do we educate the entire third-world population? It seems nearly impossible, but must happen in order for any effect to occur upon the growth rate. If only small portions of this population are to be educated and growth rate reduced, the impact on the world population will be minimal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But anything is possible; human nature is just like that. When we fail, we will try again and again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do the impossible, see the invisible! Row, row, fight the power!&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been quite a while since I&#8217;ve made a blog post, evidently. Since last year, many things have changed, and many new things have been born, including two major projects that I&#8217;ve been working on: Bear With Me and Beyond Gender.</p>
<p>One is a terribly great pun, and the other appeals widely to the demographic of society that changes as we as individuals change.</p>
<p>In short, the Bear With Me Project is dedicated to researching the propulsion necessary for mankind to efficiently colonize Mars, specifically looking at the EmDrive.&nbsp;<em>For more information, check out the link for the Bear With Me Project:&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/bear-with-me/">http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/bear-with-me/</a></p>
<p>Beyond Gender, on the other hand, will be part of a three book trilogy that discusses the definition of human, and the rise of artificial intelligence. As I write this book, I will continue my research on the definition of human, especially with aspects that focus on the inhuman &#8211; those things that so daringly hang on the ledge of the meaning of human, yet keep it all intact. I believe that just like hot and cold, or good and evil, opposites exist to fight against the other, but also maintain the other&#8217;s purity as a concept. Without evil, good cannot be appreciated, and vice versa (yes, evil can be appreciated). But the concept of human is a kind of segue away from direct opposites, but not so much that it parcels itself out into two completely unrelated topics. But it follows a similar concept to the &#8220;A must exist for B to make sense.&#8221; Without the seemingly inhuman things that occur everyday, we cannot even begin to grasp the meaning of human.</p>
<p>I may have more to say, but I feel that under the definition of human, I&#8217;ve given everyone enough to think about.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#160; In Ancient Rome, Mars was known as the god of war, but unlike his rash and hot-headed Greek counterpart, [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ancient.eu/uploads/images/2119.jpg?v=1485680542" alt="Image result for mars god" /></p>
<p>In Ancient Rome, Mars was known as the god of war, but unlike his rash and hot-headed Greek counterpart, his reputation existed in valor and honor. He was regarded as the father of Romulus and Remus, the twin brothers, one of which, founded Rome. Even having the month, <em>Martius</em>, or March named after him, the influence Mars had on the Roman Empire that nearly took over the known world, was indubitably large. But what does Mars&#8217; influence on Rome have anything to do with the planet we look up at, Mars?</p>
<p>Mars the god was not named after the planet, and nor were any of the other planets. The Roman Empire obviously existed before refined telescopes could discover the planets. So the god Mars created the planet Mars or its identity at least. The Red Planet would not be the same without its name, only there because of the Roman god of war. So the idea of identity being significant to anything, even a planet, is also significant to us. Earth is the only planet that was not given a name from ancient Roman mythology. It appears that we&#8217;ve set aside a unique name to distinguish the place we call home, but will that change?</p>
<p>If humans live on Mars and still call it &#8220;Mars,&#8221; is it just a colony? Is it just like colonies that countries can have? The problem at hand is about possibly losing our identity. We can&#8217;t just assume that a colonized Mars cannot surpass Earth, simply because it <em>can</em>. Some of the smartest and creative people living on Mars could easily utilize technologies established on Mars better than they could have on Earth. This kind of advancement can be compared to how countries grew, but is so much larger, to the point that we can&#8217;t just expect the same thing to happen. If a colony could theoretically grow more powerful than the country that allowed it to exist, then certainly a colony planet could as well.</p>
<p>It is arguable that this doesn&#8217;t need to be worried about, as Mars will always be viewed equally to Earth, but that isn&#8217;t something that is guaranteed. Just imagine a war between planets, with troops of all countries no longer fighting against each other, but instead, fighting together, against a common enemy. With the endless possibilities that technology could follow, the amount of power and destruction that will be possible could make nuclear bombs seem like pebbles causing ripples in a pond.</p>
<p>It is now quite apparent how identity can cause death upon scales that mankind has not yet witnessed, and hopefully will not even have the opportunity to witness for hundreds of years to come. So protection of our identity as Earth seems like a viable start to this possible predicament, but it might not as well.</p>
<p>Protecting the Earth&#8217;s identity isn&#8217;t so simple. When the inhabitants of Earth are able to colonize another planet, an identity of being a ruler, or anything of higher power can be provocative. Being lower than Mars just because of technology isn&#8217;t accurate, and it seems being equal is where Earth should be set at. Earth&#8217;s equal as the Red Planet also ends up bringing  a lot of competition to how both will run as societies. Two different planets, working together to advance the same species, but also competing to see who can make the most contribution? It&#8217;s feasible, and I hope that something of the sort allows mankind to thrive.</p>
<p>In the end, we need to consider how identities are born, how they grow, and what part of growth calls for dynamic change. Just like how Roman culture influenced the Red Planet to become Mars, we need to find out what makes us Earth.</p>

<p>The innovative idea of landing utilizing propulsion: http://spacenews.com/spacex-drops-plans-for-powered-dragon-landings/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Three articles with seemingly obvious relations in that they all relate to space exploration and expansion, all may hide a deeper meaning.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-214 size-large" src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/laser-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/laser-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/laser-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/laser-830x1106.jpg 830w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/laser-230x307.jpg 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/laser-350x467.jpg 350w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/laser-480x640.jpg 480w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/laser.jpg 1772w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>The sharpest laser may be a valuable asset to making our clocks even more precise than they already can be, which doesn&#8217;t seem to be valuable at all. What can making our clocks more precise really do? Well, many things can be done with increasing the precision of our clocks. The timing of things such as launches or landings may be done in more efficient execution, as well as more accurate record. But lasers aren&#8217;t really just limited to enhancing our clocks. Unlike a single aspect of space exploration like propulsion, a laser is a piece of technology that has much more potential, capable of having many more functions than propulsion. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that propulsion is any less important than a laser being implemented into space exploration.</p>
<p>A laser of this caliber may also be able to test theories and concepts, such as Einsteins&#8217; theory of relativity. The two lasers that were fired into space were much more basic, and simply, not as powerful as what has been developed today. Such precise lasers may also be able to unveil the secrets of the world that we cannot see &#8211; specifically, the atomic, and even subatomic world. The potential of a strong laser is endless.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-215 size-full" src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/heinrich.jpg" alt="" width="736" height="296" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/heinrich.jpg 736w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/heinrich-300x121.jpg 300w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/heinrich-230x93.jpg 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/heinrich-350x141.jpg 350w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/heinrich-480x193.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" />The testing of something more reliable will be happening sooner than we expect. It is expected that the Heinrich Hertz satellite will be launching in 2021, carrying several functions and testing onboard. Roughly 20 or so technology experiments will be performed on the satellite, along with the use of multiple propulsion systems. Though the launch will happen 3-5 years from now, it may still be able to bring valuable information from the experiments that it will be performed, not mentioning the propulsion systems. The Heinrich Hertz satellite is intended to use both chemical and electric propulsion, testing the HEMP thrusters, as well as the Hall thrusters. Along with the propulsion systems and experiments, technologies such as new antennas, flexible amplifiers, processing units, etc. will be tested in their usage while in orbit.</p>
<p>The most amazing part about the satellite will be its touch upon AI (personally I am against AI&#8230;), as it will be possible to program the satellite from the Earth throughout its 15-year mission. This means that it may be able to &#8220;learn&#8221; in such a way that is guided by us. Though the satellite won&#8217;t be turning into a sentient technology that decides that humans must be destroyed, it will be able to improve and evolve during its mission, reminiscent of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-216 size-large" src="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dragon-1024x488.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="488" srcset="http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dragon-1024x488.jpg 1024w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dragon-300x143.jpg 300w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dragon-768x366.jpg 768w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dragon-830x395.jpg 830w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dragon-230x110.jpg 230w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dragon-350x167.jpg 350w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dragon-480x229.jpg 480w, http://www.piercetheheavensproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dragon.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />Maybe with enhanced technologies for many aspects, such as propulsion, timing, communications, etc., getting to Mars could be a little easier, but will the final step of getting there be easy? Landing on Mars could go in several ways, such as using parachutes to utilize air resistance for a safer landing or even propulsion. The latter is the one that Elon Musk has considered for the Dragon spacecraft. Powered landings could save time, money, and resources for the overall travel, as it could utilize the same propulsions system that was used for the majority of the trip. But a powered landing can still be volatile, as landing on a weak or uneven surface could be dangerous. Musk suggests that after a successful landing on Mars, landing pads should be constructed to make the process of landing for future spacecrafts easier.</p>
<p>But Musk&#8217;s original idea for the Dragon spacecraft&#8217;s landing has been shut down by himself, as he believes that it wouldn&#8217;t be the right way to spend resources and money at the given time. Though he hasn&#8217;t given many details on his new design, it will still have to involve propulsion for a powered landing, but be able to support a much larger spacecraft than the Dragon. He had realized that a heat shield and side-mounted thrusters implemented on the Dragon just wouldn&#8217;t cut it for a large spacecraft like the Falcon Heavy, or anything that needs to support many people. But for now, we have to consider if a powered landing is the only way to go, and if Musk&#8217;s design may be the key to allowing large quantities of people to be transported to Mars at any given time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the real question that combines all three of these articles is this:</p>
<p><em>Are they all connected?</em></p>
<p>And here is my insight on that inquiry:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all definitely interlock, but more clearly, the satellite and powered landings, as they both focus on the actual propulsion of the spacecraft. The laser is different from the other two articles, but could still help with the timing of propulsion on the spacecraft, or if technology could be developed to utilize the laser to send something more than just a numerical value of timing. Could it be possible that a laser could send the necessary energy for the initial takeoff of the EmDrive on a spacecraft, knowing that once the spacecraft has reached long distances, it will be unlikely to do such a thing? Unlike the other two articles, the laser has much more potential and risk. It could do a variety of things that can extend to things past propulsion, but does not guarantee results like the other two probably would. The satellite’s use of different propulsion systems could assess the viability of many propulsion systems, and filter out those that cannot support trips from Earth to Mars. Additionally, the powered landing seems like a direct link to the satellite, as propulsion systems can also be tested for how efficiently they would be able to provide a safe landing in Mars’ atmosphere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After looking a little more into the articles, I can see that everything about space expansion can be linked together. Though that is obvious, I understand that all these aspects of space exploration, of colonizing Mars, etc. are necessary for the most successful innovations. Without looking at everything, we won’t be able to achieve the best that we can. That being said, we probably won’t need to do so. The level that we do have to achieve to support space exploration is huge though, so assuming that we do need to be able to achieve the best of everything may be a good mindset in order to actually achieve somewhere just beneath that. But such a mindset of perfection is also not good. I think that as a group, we should be looking to work our hardest, even if we know there are some things that we can’t achieve in an allotted time period.</span></p>
